                Stig Pryds is a freediver renowned for diving to great depths unassisted by oxygen tanks. 
                Before he became a freediver, Stig Pryds was a self-employed business owner. 
                However, his life changed when he was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, upending his life due to great pain and dependency on his medication.
                <br><br>
                Unsatisfied with the decreased quality of life due to his disease, 
                he discovered freediving during some swimming classes. 
                As it turns out, he had a great gift for the sport: an exceptional ability for breath control.
                <br><br>
                This became his road towards conquering the disease that previouly debilitated him. 
                Through freediving, practicing yoga, and eating an alkaline diet, 
                he has restored and even exceeded his physical abilities pre-diagnosis, all with zero medication.
                <br><br>
                Stig Pryds shows us the indominatibility of the human spirit, unbowed by disease or depth.
